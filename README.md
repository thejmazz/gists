# gists

A repo for all my gists since gists have messy urls.

## Usage

Get the script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thejmazz/gists/master/get-raw-gists.sh
```

Add user executable rights on the file:

```bash
chmod u+x get-raw-gists.sh
```

Run it :D

```bash
./get-raw-gists.sh
```
